  Julia Aguila is an artist who combines her Filipino heritage, and familial photographs  into visual works. Originally born in the Philippines, her work is influenced by the stories of her own family as well as the cities, and vast landscapes of her homeland. As a painter and a blockprinter, she seeks to transform and immortalize the memories behind the people who were photographed, and the memories of the places where she grew up. She is currently a BFA3 at the California Institute of the Arts for Art.
